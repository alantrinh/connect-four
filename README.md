# Connect Four

## Overview

Our first project at Spiced Academy took place at the end of the third week. Over the course of a Friday and the weekend we were tasked with recreating a web app version of Connect Four using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. One requirement was that we incorporate some sort of animation into our game. I chose to animate the falling of the chip as they were dropped and to flash the winning sequence once someone won the game. For this project I also used jQuery.
